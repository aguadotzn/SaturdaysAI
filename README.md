## Introduction
Cancer has life changing implications and brain metastases are currently one of the hardest to treat (see glossary for more). But there is hope, early detection and effective treatment go a long way to ensure patients have the best odds against the disease. 
Objectives

## Objectives
One of our goals was to accurately predict how much time is left to savor life. The second goal is just as important, determining when a person is likely to relapse. We’ll run you through our dataset, how we explored the data, decided on an appropriate Machine Learning (ML) approach and our results. We hope this summary helps anyone interested in this dataset and we look forward to your feedback and comments.

## Conclusions
We divide our work into:
- Predicting patient relapse - Obtain predictive variables to estimate the recurrence.
- Survival - An estimate of the number of days (and possible cause) a patient has left.
